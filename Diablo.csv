5cpgci,"If this thread gets 1000 upvotes, the design of r/diablo will change from D3 to D1"
9tu3u4,Blizzard used to cancel games like ghost and titan for not meeting Blizzard quality. Now they are outsourcing and reskinning games. I’m not sad just disappointed and angry.
5lkslg,"If this thread gets 1000 upvotes, the design of r/diablo will stay like this until the D4 is announced."

9u3ewn,"Hey Blizzard, I hate to be the one to bring this up, but this PR nightmare that you are dealing with right now? It's because everyone is connected at all times........with their phones."
