b82axv,NSFW And NSFL are very different things and should have different marks.
8h2chs,"[Feedback]Please stop refreshing my main page if I click a link. Some times I like to go back and read other stuff. But when my main page shuffles every time I load it, I miss out on things I wanted to check out. It's horrendous and it needs to stop!"

9oux74,"Since we are doing microtransactions now, can we get some opposites to Reddit Silver/Gold/Platinum to use as mega down votes?"
agu2jz,There should be a Reddit Gold free denomination that everybody gets to use once per month called Reddit Pyrite. It would make it possible for people on lower income to show enthusiasm towards certain posts and would be regarded well among the community while also not putting a dent in Reddits wallet

61699z,"[Feedback] There has been an overwhelming amount of disappointment, dissatisfaction and dislike in regards to the new ""personal pages"". Reddit, we hope you're listening."
9zhwvs,Twitter removed thousands of Russian bot accounts before midterms. Facebook did the same with hundreds. Why have so few been removed on reddit? There's absolutely no way Russia just skipped us.
